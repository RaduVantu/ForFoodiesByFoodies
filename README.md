<h2> For Fodies By Fodies </h2>

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>A restaurant and food-stall rating and review app. It was designed to run using a Firebase database to store food place details, user details and authentication. </p>
<p>It allows for three user types, admin, food critic and normal user, each with its own permissions (for example, only food critics can rate restaurants). Users have editing access to their own profile and can view other user's profiles. Anyone can use the registration feature to register on the app, but permissions are only granted by the admin.</p>
<p>Foods stalls can be added and reviewed by any user. Users have full control over their revies (edit, delete) and can rate other user's reviews. The app also offers the posibility to book a table at any one of the available restaurants, by redirecting the user to the reservations website for the food place.</p>
